****************Note

//  { body, ...customConfig } what is mean by this in js
ChatGPT
In JavaScript, the expression { body, ...customConfig } is used in object destructuring and object spread syntax.

Object Destructuring:

{ body, ...customConfig } is typically used to destructure an object and extract specific properties from it. body is a property you want to extract, and customConfig is the rest of the object.
For example, if you have an object like this:

javascript
Copy code
const myObject = {
  body: "Some text",
  color: "blue",
  size: "medium"
};
You can use object destructuring to extract the body property and store the rest of the properties in a variable like this:

javascript
Copy code
const { body, ...customConfig } = myObject;
After this operation, body will contain the value "Some text", and customConfig will be an object containing { color: "blue", size: "medium" }.

Object Spread Syntax:

{ body, ...customConfig } can also be used to create a new object by spreading properties from another object. In this case, it's used to create a new object with the properties of customConfig, and the body property from some other source.
For example:

javascript
Copy code
const customConfig = {
  color: "red",
  size: "large"
};

const someText = "Hello, World!";

const newObj = { body: someText, ...customConfig };
In this case, newObj will be { body: "Hello, World!", color: "red", size: "large" }. 
It combines the body property from someText and the properties from customConfig into a new object.


***************   lec 9 -------- props Validation


in small project we dont need of props validation but when project grow
we may pass lot of props that will rise some issue and that will lead to some error
so in that case we needed of props validation.

for that we avode bugs by props checking there are multiple package are available for 
pprops checking like FLOW package that build by fb itself , or props type package
or by type checking using these three method we can validate pprops.

//installing prop-types

npi i prop-types

//imppporting prop-types in our component

import PropTypes from 'prop-types'


//now teling our props is an array in component home 

const Home = ({posts}){
  return (
    <div>
      Home
    </div>
  )
}

Home.PropTypes = {
  posts : PropTypes.array.isRequired,
}
