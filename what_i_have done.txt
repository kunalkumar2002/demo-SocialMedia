//  { body, ...customConfig } what is mean by this in js
ChatGPT
In JavaScript, the expression { body, ...customConfig } is used in object destructuring and object spread syntax.

Object Destructuring:

{ body, ...customConfig } is typically used to destructure an object and extract specific properties from it. body is a property you want to extract, and customConfig is the rest of the object.
For example, if you have an object like this:

javascript
Copy code
const myObject = {
  body: "Some text",
  color: "blue",
  size: "medium"
};
You can use object destructuring to extract the body property and store the rest of the properties in a variable like this:

javascript
Copy code
const { body, ...customConfig } = myObject;
After this operation, body will contain the value "Some text", and customConfig will be an object containing { color: "blue", size: "medium" }.

Object Spread Syntax:

{ body, ...customConfig } can also be used to create a new object by spreading properties from another object. In this case, it's used to create a new object with the properties of customConfig, and the body property from some other source.
For example:

javascript
Copy code
const customConfig = {
  color: "red",
  size: "large"
};

const someText = "Hello, World!";

const newObj = { body: someText, ...customConfig };
In this case, newObj will be { body: "Hello, World!", color: "red", size: "large" }. It combines the body property from someText and the properties from customConfig into a new object.
